                    I received my Bachelors of Music Education in Music Therapy
                    from the University of Kansas, and completed an internship
                    at Expressive Therapies Utah in the Salt Lake City area. I
                    have worked with a wide variety of needs and populations,
                    including adolescents and adults in mental health treatment,
                    adults and children with special needs, adult oncology,
                    memory care, assisted living, and hospice. I recognize the
                    whole person, encourage self awareness, and believe that
                    with the right support, people can achieve their full
                    potential. I am committed to providing music therapy
                    services that acknowledge each individualâ€™s journey and that
                    provide opportunities for growth and change at any stage of
                    life.
