                <p>
                  Music therapy has been shown in repeated peer-reviewed studies
                  to significantly improve a wide range of psychological
                  conditions. It’s an especially effective treatment method for
                  adolescents, as they usually already have a strong personal
                  relationship with music. This connection serves as a natural
                  starting point for the therapist, makes the teen more
                  open-minded about therapy, and easily allows for personalized
                  and effective interventions.

                There is no standard group or individual session structure, as
                everything is designed around the specific needs and goals of
                the clients. In many cases, I adapt sessions on the fly in
                response to an in-the-moment need expressed during therapy. That
                said, some of the most effective interventions for adolescents

                Time and again, I have seen these methods result in increased

                improved social interaction, stress reduction, uplifted mood,
                and decrease in symptoms of anxiety and depression.
