                <p>
                  Music therapy has been shown in repeated peer-reviewed studies
                  to significantly improve a wide range of psychological
                  conditions. Itâ€™s an especially effective treatment method for
                  adolescents, as they usually already have a strong personal
                  relationship with music. This connection serves as a natural
                  starting point for the therapist, makes the teen more
                  open-minded about therapy, and easily allows for personalized
                  and effective interventions.

                There is no standard group or individual session structure, as
                everything is designed around the specific needs and goals of
                the clients. In many cases, I adapt sessions on the fly in
                response to an in-the-moment need expressed during therapy. That
                said, some of the most effective interventions for adolescents
                include:

                    A popular intervention among adolescents, this involves the
                    client sharing music that they have a personal connection
                    with. Often, this leads to a discussion about their own
                    experiences, and provides a comfortable, non-threatening way
                    for the client to reveal more about themselves.

                    Creating music in the moment gives adolescents the chance to
                    practice a variety of skills such as creating group
                    connection, active listening, self expression, and problem
                    solving. Adolescents are able to make connections between
                    their experiences in the music and how that relates to their
                    communication styles, emotional and behavioral needs, roles
                    in peer groups and family, and much more.

                    In re-creation, adolescents collaborate to interpret and
                    perform familiar songs, which develops skills such as
                    negotiation, listening, and problem solving. This
                    intervention allows creative freedom within parameters that
                    set safe boundaries for adolescents. Lyric interpretation
                    can also be used to facilitate insight.

                    Original songwriting allows space and creative freedom to
                    express thought and encourage change. Through songwriting,
                    adolescents may gain a better understanding of their
                    previous life experiences, facilitate personal development,
                    and reinforce positive thoughts and behaviors. Though this
                    can be a challenging intervention, it is also incredibly
                    powerful.

                    Relaxation and mindfulness techniques allow clients to reset
                    and use coping skills. Music provides a unique opportunity
                    to promote and guide relaxation. Music can also encourage
                    mindfulness by taking into consideration each musical
                    element and how it affects the present moment.

                and decrease in symptoms of anxiety and depression.
